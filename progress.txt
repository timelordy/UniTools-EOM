 # Progress Log - CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
 
 ## Project Context
 - pyRevit extension for Revit automation
 - Uses IronPython 2.7 (Revit runtime)
 - Tests can run with Python 3.x (pytest)
 - One existing test file: tests/test_pk_indicator_rules.py
 
 ## Iteration Log
 (Append learnings here as stories are completed)
 
 ## 2026-01-17 - US-001 through US-006, US-008
 - Implemented full CI/CD infrastructure in one pass
 - Files created:
   - pyproject.toml - project config with dev dependencies and tool settings
   - requirements-dev.txt - pip-installable dev dependencies
   - .flake8 - flake8 configuration (ignores E501, W503, E203)
   - .github/workflows/ci.yml - GitHub Actions CI pipeline
   - .pre-commit-config.yaml - pre-commit hooks
   - Makefile - Unix commands (lint, test, check)
   - dev.ps1 - PowerShell equivalent for Windows
 - **Learnings for future iterations:**
   - No Python in PATH on this Windows machine - cannot verify linting locally
   - pyRevit uses IronPython 2.7 but tests run on Python 3.x
   - CI will run on GitHub Actions with Python 3.11
